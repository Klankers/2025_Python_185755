Code, including learning and practice, for the UCSD Python Programming Fundamentals course. Jan. 14th 2025.

##   UCSD's Python Programming Fundamentals Course

Different folders will be built for the different assignments.

Textbook - *Think Python* ([link to old, free book](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)) by Allen Downey, published by O'Reilly. It's simple, but Dr. Chen likes the way he approaches things.

Any Python version 3.8/3.10 and up is fine.

Built a new conda environment called `classwork` for this course. Got through the introduction and see if Dr. Chen has a list of things to install, found info in notes and resources. Installed almost everything using `conda create -n classwork anaconda`.

The last installation thing will be the linter, `flake8`. It's good for code consistency. See pep8.org for information about the style guide. **Points will be subtracted if the code does not pass the flake8 linter.** Execute the linter from the command line by using `flake8 HW1.py` - if it passes, no warnings will be printed out.

It looks like the course uses REPL for development, or at least, the professor does. **Reminder:** This is just the Python shell that comes installed. However, she just requires some sort of Python shell. `ipython` or Jupyter notebooks work.

Key takeaways and major topics from *the course introduction*:
* Emphasis on "Pythonic" computer science abstractions
* Comprehensions
* Smart iterations
* Object-oriented programming
* Testing and test-driven development concepts

Key takeaways from Dr. Chen's intro:
* Help setting up the environment
* Coding style guide
* Data structures
* Comprehensions
* Iterables (itertools)
* Exceptions and error handling
* CLI - documentation and handling arguments
* Testing and debugging (pdb), unit tests, and development principles
* Classes and OOP
* Collections module
* Files and file handling
* Documentation tools
* Standard libraries in Python
* Third-party libraries

This course will not have any graphics or visual outputs, so online sources can be utilized.
